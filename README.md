## Project Overview

**MasterDoodly** leverages cutting-edge AI and serverless architecture to offer a dynamic platform for creating and refining designs. Our tools transform simple sketches into detailed artwork, automate design processes, and facilitate collaboration with smart AI-driven features.

## Features

### AI-Powered Sketching

- **Smart Sketch Enhancement:** Use AI to refine and detail rough sketches into polished designs.
- **Artistic Style Transfer:** Apply various artistic styles to your sketches to create unique visual effects.
- **Adaptive Brush Tools:** Intelligent brushes that adjust to your drawing style and technique.

### Automated Design Tools

- **Design Generation:** Automatically generate intricate designs and diagrams from basic sketches or parameters.
- **3D Model Conversion:** Transform 2D sketches into interactive 3D models for visualization and prototyping.
- **Design Simulation:** Test and visualize designs in various simulated environments.

### Collaborative Features

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Collaborate on sketches and designs with others in real-time, supported by AI-driven tools.
- **Feedback Integration:** Collect, manage, and integrate feedback into your designs using AI assistance.

### Personalization and Customization

- **Customizable Interface:** Tailor the UI and toolset to your individual workflow and preferences.
- **AI Recommendations:** Receive personalized suggestions for tools, styles, and techniques based on your work.

### Advanced Analytics

- **Design Quality Evaluation:** Analyze your designs for quality, efficiency, and structural integrity.
- **Predictive Insights:** Use AI to predict potential design issues and suggest improvements.

## Architecture

**MasterDoodly** uses a modern serverless architecture and advanced documentation to ensure scalability and efficiency:

- **Serverless Microservices:** Utilize Azure Functions to handle tasks like sketch processing and design generation, offering scalability and reduced operational overhead.
- **Swagger API Documentation:** Document APIs with Swagger for interactive and up-to-date documentation, making it easier for developers to understand and use the APIs.
- **Bash CLI Wrapper:** A command-line interface for interacting with APIs, automating tasks, and integrating with other tools.
